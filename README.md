# learn go with tests
examples and exercises of book Learn Go with tests 

I read the book (Learn Go with tests)[https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/] and make the (examples)[...] and (exercises)[...] proposed.

Here i'll make a simple presentation about de TDD pattern, some topics and Go sintax and quirks what i learned when read this book.

## Discipline
Let's seeing the cycle of TDD:

- Write a test
- Make the compiler pass
- Run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful
- Write enough code to make the test pass
- Refactor

This is the steps to apply the TDD correctly!
